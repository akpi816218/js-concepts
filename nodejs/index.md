# Node.js

- [Backend](./backend)

From [nodejs.dev](https://nodejs.dev): "Node.js is a free, open-sourced, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser."

This means that developers are no longer limited to a browser and can run JavaScript locally on their machines, similar to how one would run a server using Python.

Syntax is the same, but there is added support for packages and modules. The package manager shipped with Node.js is `npm`, which stands for Node Package Manager. Visit [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) to look for packages.
